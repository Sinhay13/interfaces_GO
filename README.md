Greetings and File Names

This Go program defines two types of bots, englishBot and spanishBot, that implement the bot interface with a getGreeting() method. The printGreeting() function takes a bot argument and prints its greeting to the console.

The program also includes a main() function that demonstrates how to use the printGreeting() function with both types of bots.

In addition, the program includes a main() function that prints the command-line arguments passed to the program using the os.Args variable. If an argument is provided, it prints it to the console as well.

Usage

To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the main.go file and run the following command:

$ go run main.go

This will execute the main() function and print the greetings of both types of bots to the console.

To pass command-line arguments to the program, run the following command:

$ go run main.go arg1 arg2 ...

This will execute the main() function and print the command-line arguments to the console.
